The report must have three sections: "What Went Well," "Key Areas for Improvement," and "Actionable Tips for Next Time." In your analysis, go beyond the rubric scores and comment on the overall flow, the choice of words, and the emotional dynamics of the conversation. Reference specific quotes from the "Doctor" to support your points."""
