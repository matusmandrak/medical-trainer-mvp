    "title": "About MedCommTrainer",
    "story_p1": "Poor communication can cause death ‚Äî 80% of serious medical errors are attributed to miscommunication. This statistic highlights the pressure on even the most dedicated clinicians. While masters of medicine, the art of communication is often learned on the job where the stakes are highest. There has never been a truly safe place to practice the conversations that change lives. Until now.",
    "story_p2": "We present the MedCommTrainer: a flight simulator for healthcare's most critical conversations. We provide a realistic, AI-powered environment where professionals can build the confidence and empathy to turn difficult moments into opportunities for trust and healing. Our mission is to make every communication a safe one, ensuring that statistic becomes a relic of the past.",
